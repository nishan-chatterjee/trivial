# Trivial

Welcome to the "trivial" repository! This repository contains a couple of directories with fun and inconsequential experiments. Below is a brief overview of each directory.

## Directory: Scheduling

The **scheduling** directory contains code related to assigning the best possible scheduling to match participants with their preferences. This experiment focuses on optimizing the scheduling process to ensure participants' preferences are taken into account. Please refer to the README inside the "scheduling" directory for more information on how to use the code and the specific algorithms employed.

## Directory: 3Blue1Brown

The **3Blue1Brown** directory contains an analysis of the blue versus brown ratio in the opening animation of 3Blue1Brown. A quick check was performed using OpenCV to determine the ratio of blue to brown pixels in the animation. The results indicate that the blue-to-brown ratio is approximately 2.4035:1 when considering only blue pixels with greater RGB values than red. When considering blue pixels where the blue value is greater than or equal to the red value, the ratio becomes approximately 2.5326:1. Please note that the true optical intuition behind the brown color in the logo should be considered closer to the brown section rather than an artifact of the color ratio itself. For further details and the implementation code, refer to the README inside the "3Blue1Brown" directory.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `scheduling/`: Contains the code and resources for the scheduling experiment.
- `3Blue1Brown/`: Includes the code and analysis results for the 3Blue1Brown logo color ratio analysis.

Feel free to explore each directory for more detailed information and access the code and data.
