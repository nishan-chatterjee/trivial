Fun incosequential experiments

Note on the 3blue1brown_logo_ratio implementation:
The true optical intuition behind the brown of the logo should rather be thought of being closer to the brown section, and not an artifact of the color ratio of the logo itself (which results in brown points on the edge of the eye). Correct that in the next implementation.
